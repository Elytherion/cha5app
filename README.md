# Optolith Character Generator

This is the bug and feature tracker for Optolith, a desktop application for The Dark Eye 5th Edition.

## The source code of the app has been made open source, so I merged both repositories. You can find the combined one at https://github.com/elyukai/optolith-client! Please submit issues over there!

This repository has been archived due to this change.

## Installing

You can download the app [here (German page)](http://www.ulisses-ebooks.de/product/209711) or here [here (English page)](http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/220253) (same app on both pages). You'll get an installer for Windows and a DMG for Mac, both with Auto Update support. For Linux, you have to use the .tar.gz, but I am working on an Auto Updater for Linux via AppImage.

It is available for Windows 7+ as well as for Linux (Ubuntu 12.04+, Fedora 21, Debian 8) and macOS 10.9+ x64.
