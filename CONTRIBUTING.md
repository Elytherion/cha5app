# Instructions for reporting bugs

## 1. Already existing?

[Check](https://github.com/Elytherion/tdeheroes/issues) if the issue you want to report already exists.

## 2. Do you need help?

If you have a question please use the [listed forums](https://github.com/Elytherion/tdeheroes) instead of creating an issue!

## 3. Did you find a bug?

Please include the following:

- The version of the app you are using. You can find the version in the About > Third-party licenses section of the app.
- A *detailed* description of what you have done.
- What you expected to happen and what actually happened.

The Alpha version also provides access to the Chrome DevTools via the bug button in the top right corner. If you are not familiar with web development: Check if there are any errors shown in the Console tab. In that case please include the error message (first line is enough).

## 4. Do you have a suggestion?

You can suggest features either in the issues tracker or (better) in one of the [listed forums](https://github.com/Elytherion/tdeheroes).
