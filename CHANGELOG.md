# 0.48.1

- Undo function is working again for advantages, disadvantages and special abilities.
- Spells can now be de/activated as intended.
- Cantrips/Blessing are now sorted on the character sheet.
- The total attribute maximum is shown on the attribute page during character creation.

# 0.48.0

- Heaps of bugs fixed. I lost sight of all bugs, so I won't provide a detailed list this time.
- Added a funtion to duplicate heroes.
- New interface for managing permanent AE/KP loss.
- Windows x86 support. (I am sorry for all the macOS users out there; I am still searching for a good way to build for Mac as I do not have a Mac at home.)
- Removed support for heroes created with app version lower than 0.45.0.
- If advantage/disadvantage list is empty, a placeholder will be shown. This is to ensure that having an empty list is intentional - and not a bug.

## German Specific

- Aventurian Names, Inns & Taverns, Aventurian Bestiary and The Warring Kingdoms are fully implemented (they should be). All entries from Aventurian Magic I are available. Optional Rules from AMI are not (yet) available.
- AMI is now basically complete. During reworking the entries some issues occured that might cause your characters to not work properly.
	- Selecting *Meistertalentierte*, *Zauberbarden* or *Zaubertänzer* as your magical tradition requires a second selection. *Meistertalentierte* choose their *Meistertalent*, *Zauberbarden* or *Zaubertänzer* choose their music/dance tradition (Ceoladir etc). If the affected characters are in character creation phase, you will be able to remove the existing tradition special ability and reactivate it with the correct selection. If character creation is finished, you have to create the respective character(s) again.
	- *Exorzist I* and *Meistertrick I* were missing selection options. Now they are included. The selection options do not affect the AP cost, so you can try to fix it the same way as you did for the magical tradition above.

# 0.47.3

- The requirement *Manifesto 10* for Elemental Servant referred to Wall of Fog instead of Manifesto.

# 0.47.2

- The calculations of total weight and total price in equipment tab should work again. Armor is excluded from the total weight calculation, because armor is excluded from carrying capacity if its in use.
- Character Sheet is working again.
- The skills tab contains a pane on the right side. If you click on the "i" buttons, it will show you additional information about the respective skill. Well, it will show you in the future: Currently, there is not much data available to show.
- The item list now properly resets for every new character.

# 0.47.1

- Fixed an issue with a race or a culture as a requirement. This issue caused some professions to never appear in the list.
